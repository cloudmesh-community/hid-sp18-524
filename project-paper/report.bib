It has a population of 62,262,000 people and a reported GDP of {\$}2.260 trillion Great Britain Pounds. The United Kingdom provides public healthcare to all permanent residents, about 58 million people. Healthcare coverage is free at the point of need, and is paid for by general taxation. About 18{\%} of a citizen's income tax goes towards healthcare, which is about 4.5{\%} of the average citizen's income. Overall, around 8.4 percent of the UK's gross domestic product is spent on healthcare (an amount of around 0.18984 trillion GBP). UK also has a growing private healthcare sector that is still much smaller than the public sector.},

abstract = {China has gone through a comprehensive health care insurance reform since 2003 and achieved universal health insurance coverage in 2011. The new health care insurance system provides China with a huge opportunity for the development of health care and medical research when its rich medical resources are fully unfolded. In this study, we review the Chinese health care system and its implication for medical research, especially within clinical epidemiology. First, we briefly review the population register system, the distribution of the urban and rural population in China, and the development of the Chinese health care system after 1949. In the following sections, we describe the current Chinese health care delivery system and the current health insurance system. We then focus on the construction of the Chinese health information system as well as several existing registers and research projects on health data. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of the health care system in regard to clinical epidemiology research. China now has three main insurance schemes. The Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) covers urban employees and retired employees. The Urban Residence Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) covers urban residents, including children, students, elderly people without previous employment, and unemployed people. The New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS) covers rural residents. The Chinese Government has made efforts to build up health information data, including electronic medical records. The establishment of universal health care insurance with linkage to medical records will provide potentially huge research opportunities in the future. However, constructing a complete register system at a nationwide level is challenging. In the future, China will demand increased capacity of researchers and data managers, in particular within clinical epidemiology, to explore the rich resources.},

abstract = {This chapter revises the most important aspects in how computing infrastructures should be configured and intelligently managed to fulfill the most notably security aspects required by Big Data applications. One of them is privacy. It is a pertinent aspect to be addressed because users share more and more personal data and content through their devices and computers to social networks and public clouds. So, a secure framework to social networks is a very hot topic research. This last topic is addressed in one of the two sections of the current chapter with case studies. In addition, the traditional mechanisms to support security such as firewalls and demilitarized zones are not suitable to be applied in computing systems to support Big Data. SDN is an emergent management solution that could become a convenient mechanism to implement security in Big Data systems, as we show through a second case study at the end of the chapter. This also discusses current relevant work and identifies open issues.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the use of intelligently connected devices and systems to leverage data gathered by embedded sensors and actuators in machines and other physical objects. IoT is expected to spread rapidly over the coming years and this convergence will unleash a new dimension of services that improve the quality of life of consumers and productivity of enterprises, unlocking an opportunity that the GSMA refers to as the 'Connected Life'. For consumers, the IoT has the potential to deliver solutions that dramatically improve energy efficiency, security, health, education and many other aspects of daily life. For enterprises, IoT can underpin solutions that improve decision-making and productivity in manufacturing, retail, agriculture and other sectors. Machine to Machine (M2M) solutions -a subset of the IoT – already use wireless networks to connect devices to each other and the Internet, with minimal direct human intervention, to deliver services that meet the needs of a wide range of industries. In 2013, M2M connections accounted for 2.8{\%} of global mobile connections (195 million), indicating that the sector is still at a relatively early stage in its development. An evolution of M2M, the IoT represents the coordination of multiple vendors' machines, devices and appliances connected to the Internet through multiple networks. While the potential impact of the IoT is considerable, a concerted effort is required to move beyond this early stage. In order to optimise the development of the market, a common understanding of the distinct nature of the opportunity is required.

@article{EHR,
abstract = {After reading this chapter, you should know the answers to these questions: ● What is the definition of an electronic health record (EHR)? ● How does an EHR differ from the paper record? ● What are the functional components of an EHR? ● What are the benefits of an EHR? ● What are the impediments to development and use of an EHR? 12.1 What Is An Electronic Health Record? The preceding chapters introduced the conceptual basis for the field of biomedical informatics, including the use of patient data in clinical practice and research. We now focus attention on the patient record, commonly referred to as the patient's chart or medical record. The patient record is an amalgam of all the data acquired and cre-ated during a patient's course through the health care system. The use of medical data was covered extensively in Chapter 2. We also discussed the limitations of the paper record in serving the many users of patient information. In this chapter, we examine the definition and use of computer-based patient record systems, discuss their potential benefits and costs, and describe the remaining challenges to address in their dissemination. 12.1.1 Purpose of a Patient Record Stanley Reiser (1991) wrote that the purpose of a patient record is " to recall observa-tions, to inform others, to instruct students, to gain knowledge, to monitor performance, and to justify interventions. " The many uses described in this statement, although diverse, have a single goal—to further the application of health sciences in ways that improve the well-being of patients, including the conduct of research and public health activities that address population health. Yet, observational studies of physicians' use of the paper-based record find that logistical, organizational, and other practical limita-tions reduce the effectiveness of traditional records for storing and organizing an ever-increasing number of diverse data. An electronic health record (EHR) is designed to overcome many of these limitations, as well as to provide additional benefits that cannot be attained by a static view of events. 447},

abstract = {The concept of big data, commonly characterized by volume, variety, velocity, and veracity, goes far beyond the data type and includes the aspects of data analysis, such as hypothesis-generating, rather than hypothesis-testing. Big data focuses on temporal stability of the association, rather than on causal relationship and underlying probability distribution assumptions are frequently not required. Medical big data as material to be analyzed has various features that are not only distinct from big data of other disciplines, but also distinct from traditional clinical epidemiology. Big data technology has many areas of application in healthcare, such as predictive modeling and clinical decision support, disease or safety surveillance, public health, and research. Big data analytics frequently exploits analytic methods developed in data mining, including classification, clustering, and regression. Medical big data analyses are complicated by many technical issues, such as missing values, curse of dimensionality, and bias control, and share the inherent limitations of observation study, namely the inability to test causality resulting from residual confounding and reverse causation. Recently, propensity score analysis and instrumental variable analysis have been introduced to overcome these limitations, and they have accomplished a great deal. Many challenges, such as the absence of evidence of practical benefits of big data, methodological issues including legal and ethical issues, and clinical integration and utility issues, must be overcome to realize the promise of medical big data as the fuel of a continuous learning healthcare system that will improve patient outcome and reduce waste in areas including nephrology.},

Transforming clinical data into knowledge to improve patient care has been the goal of biomedical informatics professionals for many decades, and this work is now increasingly recognized outside our field. In reviewing the literature for the past three years, we focus on "big data" in the context of EHR systems and we report on some examples of how secondary use of data has been put into practice. METHODS We searched PubMed database for articles from January 1, 2011 to November 1, 2013. We initiated the search with keywords related to "big data" and EHR. We identified relevant articles and additional keywords from the retrieved articles were added. Based on the new keywords, more articles were retrieved and we manually narrowed down the set utilizing predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS Our final review includes articles categorized into the themes of data mining (pharmacovigilance, phenotyping, natural language processing), data application and integration (clinical decision support, personal monitoring, social media), and privacy and security. CONCLUSION The increasing adoption of EHR systems worldwide makes it possible to capture large amounts of clinical data. There is an increasing number of articles addressing the theme of "big data", and the concepts associated with these articles vary. The next step is to transform healthcare big data into actionable knowledge.},

abstract = {Bioinformatic pipelines often use large numbers of components Motivation and deploying them incurs substantial configuration and maintenance burden that remains a significant barrier to reproducible research. Our aim is to define a new paradigm and best practices for developing, distributing and running pipelines encapsulated in Docker containers (lightweight virtualization), with a focus on next generation sequencing (NGS) workflows. This approach provides several advantages, namely: efficiency, portability, versioning and reproducibility. Using the NGSeasy pipeline, a user can quickly deploy any pipeline version in any environment (e.g. operating systems, workstations, clusters, clouds). While this might also be achieved with a virtual machine (VM); VMs lack portability, have substantial overhead (disk, CPU, RAM), and require allocated resources to be provisioned statically – Docker, to a large extent, solves these issues. : We demonstrate best practices for packaging and execution of a Results multicomponent pipeline for NGS using a set of container building blocks which are versioned, modular and reusable. We present a basic " proof of concept " evaluation of a next generation sequencing pipeline in Docker containers, capable of producing meaningful results, that are comparable with public and " best practice " workflows, with little to no impact on standard computing performance. : Both versioned Dockerfiles and container images for each Availability component are published on GitHub and Docker Hub, respectively. The pipeline and containers can be pulled from Docker Hub and executed on any environment capable of running the Docker platform with minimum hardware requirements for running an NGS pipeline.},

Our objectives are to describe (1) the data Fitbit collects from its users, (2) the data Fitbit provides to its users, and (3) methods of recovering data not made available to device owners. Our analysis covers four distinct attack vectors. First, we analyze the security and privacy properties of the Fitbit device itself. Next, we observe the Bluetooth traffic sent between the Fitbit device and a smartphone or personal computer during syn-chronization. Third, we analyze the security of the Fitbit Android app. Finally, we study the security properties of the network traffic between the Fitbit smartphone or computer application and the Fitbit web service. We provide evidence that Fitbit unnecessarily obtains information about nearby Flex devices under certain circumstances. We further show that Fitbit does not pro-vide device owners with all of the data collected. In fact, we find evidence of per-minute activity data that is sent to the Fitbit web service but not provided to the owner. We also discovered that MAC addresses on Fitbit devices are never changed, enabling user-correlation attacks. BTLE credentials are also exposed on the network during device pairing over TLS, which might be intercepted by MITM attacks. Finally, we demon-strate that actual user activity data is authenticated and not provided in plaintext on an end-to-end basis from the device to the Fitbit web service.},

abstract = {CONFLICT OF INTEREST NONE DECLARED Evidence based medicine (EBM) is the conscientious, explicit, judicious and reasonable use of modern, best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. EBM integrates clinical experience and patient values with the best available research information. It is a movement which aims to increase the use of high quality clinical research in clinical decision making. EBM requires new skills of the clinician, including efficient literature-searching, and the application of formal rules of evidence in evaluating the clinical literature. The practice of evidence-based medicine is a process of lifelong, self-directed, problem-based learning in which caring for one's own patients creates the need for clinically important information about diagnosis, prognosis, therapy and other clinical and health care issues. It is not "cookbook" with recipes, but its good application brings cost-effective and better health care. The key difference between evidence-based medicine and traditional medicine is not that EBM considers the evidence while the latter does not. Both take evidence into account; however, EBM demands better evidence than has traditionally been used. One of the greatest achievements of evidence-based medicine has been the development of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, methods by which researchers identify multiple studies on a topic, separate the best ones and then critically analyze them to come up with a summary of the best available evidence. The EBM-oriented clinicians of tomorrow have three tasks: a) to use evidence summaries in clinical practice; b) to help develop and update selected systematic reviews or evidence-based guidelines in their area of expertise; and c) to enrol patients in studies of treatment, diagnosis and prognosis on which medical practice is based.},
