@article{Intro4,
abstract = "Executive Summary As a result of the continuing information explosion, many organizations now have the need to process and analyze massive volumes of data. These data-intensive computing requirements can be addressed by scalable systems based on hardware clusters of commodity servers coupled with system software to provide a distributed file storage system, job execution environment, online query capability, parallel application processing, and parallel programming development tools. The LexisNexis HPCC platform provides all of these capabilities in an integrated, easy to implement and use, commercially-available high-performance computing environment. This paper provides an introduction to the LexisNexis HPCC system architecture also referred to (in the government space) as the LexisNexis Data Analytics Supercomputer (DAS). LexisNexis Risk Solutions, an industry leader in data content, data aggregation, and information services, independently developed and implemented the HPCC platform as a solution for its own data-intensive computing requirements. In a similar manner to Hadoop (the open source implementation of MapReduce), the LexisNexis approach also uses commodity clusters of hardware running the Linux operating system and includes additional system software and middleware components to provide a complete and comprehensive job execution environment and distributed query and filesystem support needed for data-intensive computing. The HPCC platform includes a powerful high-level, heavily-optimized, data-centric declarative language for parallel data processing called ECL (Enterprise Data Control Language) which is also described in this paper. The power, flexibility, advanced capabilities, speed of development, maturity, and ease of use of the ECL programming language is a primary distinguishing factor between the LexisNexis HPCC platform and other data-intensive computing solutions.",

@article{ECL,
abstract = "Enterprise Control Language (ECL) is the query and control language developed to manage the HPCC (High Performance Cluster Computing) and truly differentiates it from other technologies in its ability to easily and efficiently provide flexible data analysis on a massive scale. This white paper explores ECL, how it works, how it tackles data problems, and how it's an easier programming language to use compared to other solutions. What is the Enterprise Control Language? The lynchpin of the HPCC is the Enterprise Control Language as it is the key that allows programmer and hardware alike to function optimally. ECL is best described as a heavily optimized, data-centric declarative language. Exactly what that means is detailed below; but the essence is that it is a language specifically designed to allow data operations to be specified in a manner which is easy to optimize and parallelize. It is also designed to allow multiple programmers to work on an ever growing array of data and maximize the leverage obtained. A reasonable, if informal, definition of a declarative language is that it is one in which you specify what you want done rather than how to do it. The most distinctive feature of them is that they are extremely succinct; it is common for a declarative language to require an order of magnitude (10x) less code than a procedural counterpart to specify the same problem. This seems like a nirvana and for a while, declarative languages were touted as 'fifth generation' and the 'languages that would put programmers out of business.",
